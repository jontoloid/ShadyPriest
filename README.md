# ShadyPriest

a zzukBot CC for Shadow Priests **and pure wand spamming!** from Level 1 onwards. This CC makes use of Mind Flay and Shadowform while also wanding for quite a big portion.
This does currently not offer any amazing features like automated talenting or anything along the lines, here is a list of the features.

* Health- and Manapotion usage
* Handling of multiple enemies (through the usage of Psychic Scream)
* Drink selection, including conjured drinks
* *(If available)* Usage of Berserking or Devouring Plague

## *possible* fixes and features to come

* **If** I ever figure this out, fixing the wand-attack spamming that cancels itself out
* Usage of Scrolls. _soon_
* Dispel annoying debuffs / cure annoying diseases (in Rest phase most likely.) _soon_
* DoTing up multiple enemies
* Massive code cleanup. _Currenty in the process of doing so, bear with me please_
*  ~~Addition of a separate, pre-40/Shadowform+Mindflay version of this (it exists, but it is an absolute mess.)~~ It's out! 1.0.3a

## Known issues

* Wanding. Just about everything about wanding, after being stunned or disarmed, it goes to fuck more often than not.
* Silence seems to be used at random (maybe when instant casts happen?). Going to look into a way to fix this, otherwise you can just turn it off.
* all the things

###**Enjoy!**
