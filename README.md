# ShadyPriest

a zzukBot CC for Shadow Priests post Level 40. This CC makes use of Mind Flay and Shadowform while also wanding for quite a big portion.
This does currently not offer any amazing features like automated talenting or anything along the lines, here is a list of the features.

* Health- and Manapotion usage
* Handling of multiple enemies (through the usage of Psychic Scream)
* Drink selection, including conjured drinks
* *(If available)* Usage of Berserking or Devouring Plague

*possible* fixes and features to come

* **If** I ever figure this out, fixing the wand-attack spamming that cancels itself out
* Usage of Scrolls
* Massive code cleanup
* Addition of a separate, pre-40/Shadowform+Mindflay version of this (it exists, but it is an absolute mess.)



Enjoy
